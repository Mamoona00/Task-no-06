*Taking input in python:

In python input() fuction is used to get input from the user. When input fuction execute, interpreter stops the execution and wait for the user input. When the user give input execution of program resume and print the input that the user entered.

by default python returns a string value. sumetimes we don't need value of strig type. In that case we have to typecast the datatype of input to another datatypes.
Simply we write the name of datatype then parenthese. In parentheses we will write our input function.

*Taking input from consol in python:

consol also called shell is the interpreter that take input from user one command at a time and interpret it.
 We just enter the command and press enter it will execute and prints the output. After that when three greater than symbol appear at next line we can write next commant.

* Taking multiple inputs from the user:

We can take multiple inputs by using two methods:
By split() function:
In python split() function is used to get input from the user. it breaks the inputs with seperator given in parantheses of split(). if separator is not given then white space is a separator.
By list comprehension:
we can take multiple inputs in list with list comprehension.

* Vulunerability in input() method in python 2.x.
In python 2 raw_input() was used to get input from user.and in python 3 it was replaced with input().
raw_input takes th value from user and and converts it into string type.
input() fuction takes the input but type wil be as it is user give.

*Output using print() function:

print() function is used to display output in python. we write print() in parentheses we put double or single quotes and in quotes we write our text that we want to display as an output.

*How to print in python without newline?

In python by default when we print something we get each each text in a new line.
For printing without newline we used end parameter in print(). write the text in "" to be displayed then write end then eaquals to (=) and then double or single quotations (" "), (' ').
Similarly we use sep parameter. 
Sep parameter separate the output. if we want to separate output by specific separator we can write it in double quotations.

*Output formating in python:

By usig % operator.

Modulus operator can be used for string formatting in print() method. Datatyp of the variabel is more important than the value in this method.
%d is used for int datatype. %s is used for string and %f or %g is used for float.

By using string format.

In this method the value written in print() is replaced with placeholder {}. The value of the variable is important than the datatype in string format method. We can also write index value in {}. Output will displayed according to the index value.
