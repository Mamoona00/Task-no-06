## * Variable, expression, condition and function
Variables:

A variable can be a name in which we can store value. We can use variable directly in python. we don't need to declre them. Simply we write the name of variable and assign it a value. Assignment operator is used to assign value to a variable. variable are case sensitive.

Expression:

Expression is a combination of operator and operands. operands can be variable and constants.
we use parentheses when expression have more than one operand.

conditions:

conditions in python are used for decision making. if, alif and else statement are used that allows us to execute block of code wether the condition is true or false.

functions:

functions in python are created by def keyword. after def we write the name of the function and then parentheses. we can also give parameters in parentheses.




## * Maximum possible value of integer
In python value if int is not fixed. python 2 had ling and int data type but python 3 has only int so we can use more bits to represent int.
value of int can be find by using sys.maxsize() function.

## * Global and local variables in python
Global variable is the one which is defined outside the function. it can be used everywhwere in the program within or without function.
Global variables can be accessed in a funtion by using keyword gloal.

Local variables are defined within a function. They can be used only within function not in entire program.If we use local variable outside the function interpreter of python will throw error.

## * Packing and unpacking arguments
Packing is a processof combining multiple arguments in a single variable.
Unpacking is a process of extracting values from a list or a tuple and assign them to variable.
* is used to pack and unpack data for a tuple or list.
** is used for dictionaries packing and unpacking.
## * Type conversion in python
Type conversion is a process of changing one datatype to another.There are two types of type conversion in python:

Implicit:

In implicit type conversion interpretser of python converts datatype to another.

Explicit:

IN explicit type conversion user converts datatype of object from one to another. It is also called typecasting because user changes the datatype.it can be done using different functions like int(), float(), str(), bool(), list(), tuple(), set() etc.
## * Byte object vs string 
In python bute represent int data and string rperesent text data.
Byte cannot print directly as text and string print directly as text.
Byte is 8-bit integer data and string is unicode character data.
encode() and decode() functions are used to conversion btween string and bytes.
## * Print single and multiple variables
print function is used to print variables in python. concatenation and f string are also used to print variables.
## *Swap variables
swap mean exchange. In python we can swap variables by using temp variable, unpacking tuple and XOR.

## * __name__ (special variable) in python
The __name__ variable (two underscore before and after) is a special variablein Python. It is used to decide whether you want to run code as scripts or you want to import function of other files as a module. If we want to know in which module we are working we used this variable.
